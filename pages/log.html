    <h1>August 2024</h1>
    <p>Finished mentorship program and <a href="https://nastiadesign.framer.website/">my Framer portfolio</a>. 
    Applied for mentorship as a mentor. Trying to avoid real work or postpone it until it gets late enough.
    Wokring on a concept of design reading group and a name is the wprst part, even worse than just gathering people in a chat (what i stil haven't done).
